  abstract	= {This thesis presents several developments in analysing
		  wind turbines in the frequency domain. Previous work in the
		  area has developed computer-based models to predict the
		  rotationally sampled stochastic wind speed witnessed by the
		  blades of a wind turbine. Work has also been carried out to
		  include rudimentaiy capabilities to model blade, tower and
		  drivetrain flexibilities. These are usually limited to
		  modelling only the first mode responses in each case. This
		  thesis describes the development of a new frequency domain
		  model with the ability to analyse fuiiy flexible turbines
		  using a Finite Element analysis approach. In addition, the
		  analysis has a number of novel features to enhance
		  convergence and minimise numerical errors. Comparisons are
		  made between the theoretical and measured results for a
		  number of commercial wind turbines. Problems with land
		  availability have recently prompted governments to
		  investigate the possibility of siting wind turbines
		  offshore. One type of concept sites turbines on floating
		  platforms. It is necessary to develop models to predict how
		  turbines influence the rigid body dynamics of the platform.
		  Additionally the wave-induced motions of the platform
		  influence dynamic loading in the turbines and this too
		  should be analysed. A new frequency domain model has been
		  advanced to calculate the forces induced through stochastic
		  wave loading on floating platforms. A promising concept,
		  based on a 'Tensioned Buoyant Platform (TBP)' has been
		  investigated and the results presented. Many recent
		  developments have been made in Frequency domain fatigue
		  analysis. An investigation into a number of methods is
		  discussed. Recommendations are made for the practicable use
		  of these methods for analyising wind turbine structures.},

  abstract	= {A methodology is presented to obtain the nonlinear
		  aeroelastic response of horizontal axis wind turbines using
		  accurate and computationally efficient aerodynamic and
		  structural descriptions. For computing the geometrically
		  nonlinear deformations of the rotor blades, we employ
		  Simo-Vu-Quoc's geometrically exact finite-strain spatial
		  rod model, which treats the displacements of the beam
		  reference line and the rotations of the cross-section as
		  configuration variables, without any restrictions on their
		  magnitudes or those of the resulting 1-D strain measures.
		  The structural description is Lagrangian, obviating the
		  need for an explicit definition of centrifugal/coriolis
		  forces. Towards the aerodynamic side, Blade Element
		  Momentum Theory enhanced with several important corrections
		  is employed, along with a dynamic stall model that accounts
		  for the unsteady effects. A comprehensive treatment of the
		  aeroelastic computations within the restrictions imposed by
		  the aerodynamic theory is presented with the aid of a
		  `shadow' frame of reference rotating rigidly with the
		  deforming blades. A novel strategy `primes' the aeroelastic
		  solver by moderating the response of rotor in its
		  acceleration phase. An integrated MATLAB tool WindGEAR
		  incorporating the two coupled codes is developed to
		  simulate the fully-coupled aeroelastic response of the NREL
		  5~MW wind turbine. The results, when compared with
		  published data, establish WindGEAR firmly as a robust wind
		  turbine nonlinear aeroelastic analysis tool in
